# Facit4070arduino
Arduino Mega driver for Facit 4070 paper tape punch

Have you got a Facit 4070 paper tape punch? 
Would you like to add a USB interface to it?
This is what you need: an Arduino Mega; A D25 connector; some wires and this code.

Just a quick hack at the moment to get the machine working, might expand it in future if I get really bored.
